# React-Data-Fetching Examples

### Declarative data fetching for React

`react-data-fetching` provides a very intuitive way to perform any REST API call without hassle, through a single React component. It also helps you take care of timeouts, loading states, errors handling, data saving, uploading/downloading progress, etc. Fetching data while letting the user know what's going on has never been that easy!

The package is really lightweight (~6 kB gzipped) and has been built from the ground up with universal apps in mind: you can use it wherever React is rendering - meaning it works seamlessly with React (web) & React Native!


## Installation

Using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```shell
$ yarn install
$ yarn run example
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080/`.
